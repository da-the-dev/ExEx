## Commands
- `xx.createProfile` - Create a profile.
- `xx.enableProfile` - Enable profiles *(leave no profiles selected to disable all extensions)*.
- `xx.deleteProfile` - Delete a profile.
- `xx.editProfile` - Edit a profile *(chage what extension to enable/disable)*.

## Known Issues
- Some extensions might require reloading the window after the profiles have been applied to activate (like Pylance for example). If some extensions are shown as enabled, but don't work, try reloading the window.

## Future features
Theese are some of my ideas for the future:
- Merge profiles
- Global profile and 'All' profile
- Syncing with settings
- Import/export a profile
- Auto-update profiles when changes are made
