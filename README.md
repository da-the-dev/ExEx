# ExEx
<span><h4>An extestion for managing extensions.</h4></span>
<hr>

Have too many extensions? Want to organise all of them? Some maybe even confilct with each other? <span style="font-size: 15pt; font-weight: bold;">ExEx</span>  was created exatly to solve these and many more problems. Now with this extestion installed you can separate you extensions into profiles and enable only those you need for a specific workspace.

## All features
- Create a profile.
- Enable many profiles at a time.
- Delete a profile.
- Edit a profile *(change extension list)*.
- Rename a profile.
- Duplicate a profile. Creates a new profile with the same extensions, but a different name. Usefull when a new profile should be created with extra extensions, but the old one must be preserved.
- Merge profiles. Select multiple profiles to merge into one.
- **Changes to profiles are automatically applied if changed profiels are enabled**.

## Commands
- `xx.createProfile` - Create a profile.
- `xx.enableProfile` - Enable profiles *(leave no profiles selected to disable all extensions)*.
- `xx.deleteProfile` - Delete a profile.
- `xx.editProfile` - Edit a profile *(chage what extension to enable/disable)*.
- `xx.renameProfile` - Rename a profile.
- `xx.duplicateProfile` - Duplicate a profile.
- `xx.mergeProfile` - Merge profiles.

## Known Issues
- Some extensions might require reloading the window after the profiles have been applied to activate (like Pylance for example). If some extensions are shown as enabled, but don't work, try reloading the window. It requires more testing. If you can, I'd appreciate if you'd report more issues.

## Future features
Theese are some of my ideas for the future:
- Syncing with settings
- Global profile and 'All' profile 
- Import/export a profile
