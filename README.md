## Known Issues
- Some extensions like jshint do not follow the traditional naming in their package.json, so they might break ExEx. Despite the fixes this issues might still happen for some users, though it is quite rare and inconsistent. Please report any issues with ExEx after installing new extensions.

## Future features
These are some of my ideas for the future:
- Syncing with settings
- Import/export a profile to a file
